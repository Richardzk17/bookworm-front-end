Bookworm is a social app where anyone can view a library of featured books that are either trending or books added by logged in users via a third-party API. Anyone can also click on a book and see its details, reviews, and posts. However, only profile users can add reviews and comments. Logged in users can also add books on their profile page to their own bookshelf. 

With Bookworm, our mission is to inspire people to explore the realms of books. We believe there are books out there for everyone, and through our platform one can embark on a journey, log it, and share their thoughts. With the resources this app provides, anyone can seek inspiration for their next journey. With Bookworm, the possibilities are endless.

Stay tuned for additional features!
